**Reflection on ProPublica visit**. ProPublica, as a non-profit journalism organization, does a lot of work in the community interest. As you start to work with you community partner and think about your [Phase 2 paper](http://arlduc.org/senseandscale/?p=1662), what are some lessons learned from the ProPublica visit that might help you going forward?

I have learned that the effective communication needed for collaboration. For instance, in my community partner with MIT CREATE, we are physically far apart. Good communication via email, weekly/bi-weekly meeting with Kate will increase productivity and relationship. I was asked to bring what type of project/question I'd like to explore \(and detail how indicating the specific steps\)? 

Understanding the characteristic of data and solutions that enhance urban development for informal and non-standard economies towards smarter, more equitable urban development.

For this community partner project, my goal is to design and create  seamless data visualization representation of urban economies and associated organizations.

I think visiting NYU Data Services was a great idea. I was keen to trying out other software platforms like Tableau and Unity. Having that concrete understand of both pros and cons. I will be able to help visualize and plan what option would be the most viable choice at my final visualization project.
