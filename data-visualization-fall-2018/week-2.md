# Week 2!

**Start Visualizing.** Use the toolkit you’re building to start visualizing data to show on September 20.

* Please post screenshots or a link to your blog, as well as a discussion of your progress.
* Please use one of the class’s [pre-approved datasets](http://arlduc.org/senseandscale/?p=1105) or e-mail me to get approval for another data set of your choice.
* You can use this assignment to start working towards your first full visualization, which will be due on October 4. \(You can see last year’s Phase 1 Project Grading Criteria [here](http://arlduc.org/senseandscale/?p=1104), which will be similar to this year’s criteria. Some of the visualization tutorials need to be updated.\)

### HTML + D3.js

I have decided to use HTML + CSS + D3.js and using JSON format as a dataset.

I am using one of the pre-approved datasets, to be more specific I am using a Total Enrollment by U.S. Medical School and Race/Ethnicity, 2015-2016 dataset provided by [Be More America](http://www.bemoreamerica.org/).
