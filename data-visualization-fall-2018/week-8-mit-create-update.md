# Week 8! - MIT CREATE UPDATE

{% hint style="info" %}
**Blog Post:** Next week’s class \(11/1\) will focus on workshopping your Phase 2 work \(due 11/8\), so please contact your chosen community partner and start preparing your [Phase 2 paper](http://arlduc.org/senseandscale/wp-admin/post.php?post=1662&action=edit)–then post as much as you can!
{% endhint %}

This Tuesday \(10/30\), Zhenwen and I discussed about our roles for the MIT CREATE project. We have received a data and visualization ideas.

We will be working together to clean the data first then have a unifying data so that it would be consistent throughout the project. Zhenwen and I will discuss if we would want to collaborate together more after the data cleanup. 

We are hoping to have a bi-weekly Skype/Google Hangout meeting with Kate starting next Friday. 

Meanwhile, we asked Kate if she can provide more about any data issues like collecting the data, cleaning the data, and understanding the data.

Most importantly, asking if there are any historical precedents for this kind of work with data?  

Cheers,

Steven
