#### 1. The Data Revolution: Big Data, Open Data, Data Infrastructures and Their Consequences

by Rob Kitchin  SAGE Publications: 2014.

I believe that this book will allow any users to learn more about the Data, whether it's conceptualizing a simple data or building any shape of data as well. Big data analytics helps organizations harness their data and use it to identify new opportunities and focuses on finding hidden threads, trends, or patterns from heaps of company data. It represents significant information which can open new avenues of opportunities and the way this information is analyzed to help tap on those underlying opportunities. 

**2. Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production \(metaLABprojects\)** 

by Johanna Drucker  Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014

Graphesis provides a graphical knowledge. I believe that it is good to study media and graphic design history, This book outlines the principles by which visual formats organize important content.
