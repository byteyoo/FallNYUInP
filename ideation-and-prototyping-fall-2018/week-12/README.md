# Week 12!

### Discovery Log Week 12: NYU Makerspace and Laser Cutter

![Laser Cutting Sunglasses Frame](../../.gitbook/assets/img_5224.jpg)

For my Ideation and Prototyping class, my partner \(Ozema\) and I were deciding to see if we want to use laser cutting machine or 3D printer to create our product.

We decided to use laser cutter because it is a lot faster to make multiple prototypes and involves less risk for any failure prints. There is a lot of adjustment and constant surveillance throughout the 3D printing process.

**What did I discovered?:** I discovered that NYU Tandon Makerspace provides a cutting edge workspace lab created to foster collaborative design projects and gives even greater opportunities for students and faculty to engage in innovative and entrepreneurial activities. I really liked the idea of collaboration and using Ozie's skillset and my strength to create something creative and innovative to our Ideation and Prototyping project. I am excited to see what we can create and present at the showcase.

Cheers,

Steven Yoo

Social Inequality \(Rich vs. Poor\):

The BPGs with LEDs on the exterior frame are the low-quality version because the light doesn’t directly hit the wearer’s pupils via the lenses like with the higher quality version. At a whopping $10,000 per pair, only the rich can afford the higher quality BPGs, and as a result poor people have worse eyesight than the rich \(Low quality BPGs cost $1000 per pair\).

* Will include price plaque in front of each type of BPG for final showcase
