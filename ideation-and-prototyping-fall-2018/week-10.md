### Dystopia

![](../.gitbook/assets/post.jpg)

At night, dogs prowled the streets. Enormous paws slapped the pavement as they wandered through the darkness, jerking at their chain restraints. Muzzles encased their muscular heads, the leather gristly with saliva and stained by pollution. Their masters walked beside them, holding thick ringed chains that collared the beasts. The Guard, as the city called them. The city itself was as grey and bleak as any other in this dying world. It was a vast monotony of ancient glass and steel, shaped by decades of destitution and chaos. The Government fears us. United, the people of the city were powerful. Yet, scattered, divided and leaderless as we are, we are incapable of revolt. How they created such a sense of anarchy and yet maintain their own level of order was remarkable, yet entirely plausible. How did they achieve such unmitigated devotion?

{% hint style="info" %}
Choose a film from the list to watch and write a 200 word response. Are they Utopian or Dystopian? Was there a single technology or event that made it that way. Could that technology or another equal event change it from Utopian to Dystopian, or Dystopian to Utopian? Are there any story elements or themes that you can borrow from for your own final project?
{% endhint %}

I watched The Matrix. I think the Matrix is a great example of a dystopia because of many characteristics that it displays. This world inside the computer fabricates what you hear, smell, see, taste and even touch. The computers feel that by controlling every minute detail of what humans are allowed to experience they are bettering the human’s lives while also preserving their own. This is a great example of technological control. These advanced machines have progressed so far as to oppress the very beings that created them. Because they have isolated and incapacitated each human, they completely control all sources of information, independent thought, freedom, or true individuality, all characteristics of a dystopian society and would like to borrow from that theme to my own final project. Also, the natural world, the world taken over by machines where each human’s body actually resides, has been completely banned from The Matrix, so much so that only a tiny fraction of the population even have knowledge of it.These technologies can change it from Dystopian to Utopian.
