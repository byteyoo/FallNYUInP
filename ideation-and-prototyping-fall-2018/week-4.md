# Week 4!

### Discovery Log Week 4: New York Academy of Sciences!

The New York Academy of Sciences was founded in January 1817.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Academy_of_Sciences#cite_note-BaatzHistory-1) It is one of the oldest societies in the U.S. An independent, non-profit organization with more than 20,000 members in 100 countries, the Academy's mission is "to advance scientific research and knowledge; to support scientific literacy; and to promote the resolution of society's global challenges through science-based solutions"

I was privileged to attend the Academy's 200th Annual Meeting and Welcome Reception on Thursday, September 27th, 2018. There was an interactive panel discussion exploring questions at the intersection of science and journalism. For example, how can the media convey the wonder and enormous potential of scientific discovery? How do many researchers seeking to engage with a broader audience find  the right balance between scientific accuracy and public accessibility?

I have discovered and found that there are many societies and organizations around the world \(and NYC, of course\). I highly value developing meaningful relationships with others. Having  that networking and has a possible alumni network as a resource for finding jobs and career opportunities. 

Cheers!

Steven Yoo
