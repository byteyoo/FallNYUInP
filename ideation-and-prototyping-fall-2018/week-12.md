### Discovery Log Week 12: NYU Makerspace and Laser Cutter

For my Ideation and Prototyping class, my partner \(Ozema\) and I were deciding to see if we want to use laser cutting machine or 3D printer to create our product.

We decided to use laser cutter because it is a lot faster to make multiple prototypes and involves less risk for any failure prints. There is a lot of adjustment and constant surveillance throughout the 3D printing process.

**What did I discovered?:** I discovered that NYU Tandon Makerspace provides a cutting edge workspace lab created to foster collaborative design projects and gives even greater opportunities for students and faculty to engage in innovative and entrepreneurial activities. I really liked the idea of collaboration and using Ozie's skillset and my strength to create something creative and innovative to our Ideation and Prototyping project. I am excited to see what we can create and present at the showcase.

Cheers,
