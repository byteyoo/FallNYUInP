# Week 3!

### Discovery Log Week 3: New York City Media Lab \(NYCML' 18\)

I had a chance to participate this year's NYCML'18  at the NYU Kimmel Center! Essentially, NYCML is a summit/conference that brings best thinking, projects, and talent from across the city's industry and university. They provide a lot of cool discussions, hands-on workshops, and more than 100 demos about the digital media innovation.

I was helping out Professor Kathleen McDermott's " **Speculative Wearable Tech + Recycled Electronics".** In this workshop, we discussed the future of wearable in relations to sustainability. We then created extreme, imaginative, and speculative designs for wearables that cannibalize electronic junk from the past 30 years. 

#### Here are some pictures taken from NYCML 18:

I have discovered that they are a lot people who are interested in this particular workshop. We were expecting around 15 people. Well... It turned out to be around 30 people! I really had a great time. I also great people from entrepreneurs, engineers, creative technologists, product designers, data scientist and makers at the NYC Media Lab. It was my first experience to learn about XR \(virtual, augmented and mixed reality\). This is a great opportunity and experience to adventure out my passion and finding my concentration for the IDM program. Stay Tuned.

Cheers,

Shout out to Todd and Kat's NYC Media Lab First Place award! \(Relevant Motion\).
