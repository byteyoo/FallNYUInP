**What have I discovered?**

The NYVR exhibit hall features the most forward-thinking companies in the space. I learned through experience with hand-crafted virtual education programs and saw live demonstrations of hardware. I spoke with the experts and creators making the tech that is going to reshape the way we live. I learned about the latest development techniques and business strategies in the 45+ sessions and panels at NYVR. Attendees will get a 30,000 ft. view of how businesses from every sector are utilizing VR/AR to enhance their products and educate consumers. Many developers and creators will get to take a focus into the platforms and tools they need to capture and share experiences or design entirely new worlds from scratch.

I was able to meet with forward-thinking developers, creators, and professionals in the advertising, leisure, education, media, healthcare, and retail industries. As the largest XR show on the East Coast, NYVR draws attendees from field unique to the area with an increased focus on business built on a bedrock of culture and creativity.
