# Week 4

For the midterm project, I want to create a cold wintery snow forest environment and log cabin home narrative story.

### Snow Winter Forest

I want to create an environment and an aesthetic narrative story to let players to enjoy and appreciate the winter forest and wildlife. Many people wants to stay under their blanket and not doing anything at all and that is so boring and depressing. I understand why people donâ€™t like winters and drink hot chocolate or have the opportunity to stay under their covers because it is not all such a nice feeling if we consider the factors leading to this.

### Log Cabin

Log cabin homes are very comfortable and they are a rustic place for your friends and family members to meet and relax. This building method can also be used as a garden office, a sitting room, a guest room or a summer-house. One should also remember that having a log cabin in your garden can be a charming accessory to add.
