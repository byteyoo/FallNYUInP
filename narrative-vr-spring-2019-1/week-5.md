# Week 5

{% hint style="info" %}
**Assignments: Continue building your worlds for midterms. Create a character \(or characters\) based on your moodboards. Have them trigger events. Begin to animate characters and objects in Sequencer.**

**Make documentation. Add some character animation tracks at some key areas and get a screenshot / screen capture.  Does this work have a title?Who are you in this experience? Refer to** [**The Four Different Types of Stories in VR**](http://voicesofvr.com/292-the-four-different-types-of-stories-in-vr/)**. Explain why your experience fits in that category.**

### Storyline update:

I have focused on building a log cabin \(without a roof, not sure how big my character are going to be\). I also mentioned that there will be log cabin and outside scenes. This week, I focused on designing the house. 

This will be mainly two characters: Jasper, a little boy that wondering around the outside world and log cabin scenes. I am planning to make a story/game to chasing from monster and your goal is to make it to the log cabin..

### Documentation

![grid detailing the four different types of story in VR:](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2821%29.png)

This story will be using WASD control to move around the world with VR  headset experience. I am still debating if I am going to add a weapon to trigger some actions \(most likely, I am going to try during my final project\).

I am going to expand my map so it will be more based on running away from the monster story.

Sincerely,

Steven Yoo
