# Week 1!

## Inputs Map {#inputs-map}

{% hint style="info" %}
Create a mind map or concept map of all of the various inputs in your life \(i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.\)+

Post to your process website. You may have to upload micro and macro views of your map as images. You may also have multiple input maps.
