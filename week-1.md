## Reading Response of Sketching: The Miseducation of the Doodle and The Visual Thinking Power Tool {#reading}

This is my reading response of the articles "The Miseducation of the Doodle and The Visual Thinking Power Tool".

During my young teenage year, I didn't want to be an artist. I wanted to make video games. Most of my artisitic interests at the time making Macromedia Flash application and comic. I think my art experience allow me to generate ideas, solving, problems, and visually communcating ideas more effectively.

I was raised in a family where both of my parents were an artist and a musician (composer). When I was 8, I'd always carry around my blank sketchbook and start drawing my own comics. Unfortunately, most of my sketchbooks were burnt and thrown away when I was moving to America.
