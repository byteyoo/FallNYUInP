{% hint style="info" %}
Create a mind map or concept map of all of the various inputs in your life \(i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.\)

During my young teenage year, I didn't want to be an artist. I wanted to make video games. Most of my artisitic interests at the time making Macromedia Flash application and drawing comic by sketch and pencils/pens. I think my art experience allow me to generate ideas, solving, problems, and visually communcating ideas more effectively. There is something special about the mix of thinking and handwork that enhances the ideas our brain process. As an engineer, it also reminded me that the value of sketching extends beyond design as a visualization tool for solving engineering problems.

I was raised in a family where both of my parents were an artist and a musician \(composer\). When I was 8, I'd always carry around my blank sketchbook and start drawing my own comics. I used draw comic book series \(Roughly 4 volumes\). Unfortunately, most of my sketchbooks were burnt and thrown away when I was moving to America. Essentially, I want to refine these characters and storyline to create an indie game.
