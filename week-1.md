## Inputs Map {#inputs-map}

{% hint style="info" %}
Create a mind map or concept map of all of the various inputs in your life \(i.e. this is the total range of what comes into you from outside of your own imagination.\)

Post to your process website. You may have to upload micro and macro views of your map as images. You may also have multiple input maps.

During my young teenage year, I didn't want to be an artist. I wanted to make video games. Most of my artisitic interests at the time making Macromedia Flash application and drawing comic by sketch and pencils/pens. I think my art experience allow me to generate ideas, solving, problems, and visually communcating ideas more effectively. There is something special about the mix of thinking and handwork that enhances the ideas our brain process. As an engineer, it also reminded me that the value of sketching extends beyond design as a visualization tool for solving engineering problems.

I was raised in a family where both of my parents were an artist and a musician \(composer\). When I was 8, I'd always carry around my blank sketchbook and start drawing my own comics. I used draw comic book series \(Roughly 4 volumes\). Unfortunately, most of my sketchbooks were burnt and thrown away when I was moving to America. Essentially, I want to refine these characters and storyline to create an indie game soon.

## Discovery Log Week 1: Personal Technology Setup

I am starting my weekly update with my personal technology setup. Technology is important in today's world because it serves a variety of functions in many of the important aspects of modern society, for example, education, media, and business. During the past few years, in particular, computers have become, such an integral part of our society that technology has become a relied-on tool for most people.

With that being said, let's look at my personal computer setup.
I have attached my PC computer parts in this link! Check it out!

Purpose: Multi-purpose, gaming, heavy graphic rendering and editing. For example, Unity Engine and Unreal Engine.

Motherboard: I went with one of the cheapest options that supports my CPU and RAM. Works great!

CPU: I went with Intel - Core i7-4790K 4GHz Quad-Core Processor, amazin for multithreading and rendering ability. I bought this CPU for my future long investment.

CPU Cooler: Nothing special, Intel stock cooler.

RAM: went with Corsair - Vengeance 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory. If you are more heavy graphic/video editor, I would highly recommend upgrading your RAM to 16GB.

GPU: I believe GeForce GTX 960 Video Card is a minimum requirement for a lot of graphic/video editing software. Still  works great for editing/rendering and awesome for gaming.
